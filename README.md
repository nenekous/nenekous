# About me âœ‹!

Hi, my name is Anin, a dedicated quality assurance since 2020. With a keen eye for details and strong dedication, I've specialized my skills in game testing while also adeptly navigating in web and app testing. However, this is just the beginning of my journey, as I am eager to expand my skill set and gain more experience. In the future, I envision enhancing my expertise in automation quality assurance.

Besides quality assurance, I also enjoy learning new languages. Other than English, I am also able to converse in Bahasa Indonesia, Japanese, Javanese, and Sundanese. With my language prowess, I can collaborate with diverse team members from around the globe.

Motivated by an insatiable appetite for challenge, I thrive on the opportunity to test and refine new digital products before they are released. As I journey through this exciting career path, I'm eager to share my experiences and accomplishments from my three years in the field.
